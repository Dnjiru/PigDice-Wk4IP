{This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100.The following are Simple Rules to Observe

When the player rolls a 2 - 6, the dice score is added to their turn total and they can continue to play.
When a player rolls a 1, their total score reverts to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
When the player chooses to "hold"(pass their turn), their turn total is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The player who first scores 100 or more points wins the game.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
{This is a Web Application developed on HTML, CSS and Java Script. All you need to run is a browser and internet. However, if you have the code locally, it can run on your computer browser.}
## Behavior Driven Development(BDD)
{Before writing this code, I focused first on the behaviours that I would want to see in our final application. I considered what the program should do, thought through possible scenarios when the user would encounter when interacting with the application. You roll the dice and when you get 1, you round is out. You can be able to choose the dice and end the round. 

Therefore, I developed an application that will take a chance to throw the dice and get as many chances as possible. If the totals hit 100. You win }
